===============

Script to control notebooks' dual AMD/Intel videocards.

Usage:
1) boot - recommended command for autoboot setup. On boot by default both videocards are enabled. This command enables Intel only. AMD videocards are mostly used for games, which are rarely most used applications in Linux. 
2) check - echoes current condition of videocards on and off.
3) switch - usage: "r", "i". "r" enables AMD and disables Intel. "i" enables Intel and disables AMD.
